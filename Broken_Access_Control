Access control vulnerabilities and privilege escalation

Access control is dependent on authentication and session management.

AUTHENTICATION - identifies the user and confirms that they are who they say they are.
SESSION MANAGEMENT - identifies which subsequent HTTP request made by the same user.
ACCESS CONTROL - determines whether the user is allowed to carry out the action that they are attempting to perform
